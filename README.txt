This is a project that uses the Spotify Web API to search for playlists and identify trends 
and associations between different tracks that come up in those playlists. This is intended 
to be used to generate new playlists for genres that are based off of what the most popular 
results for that search are, but really it could be used for any type of associating a word
with certain songs.

To get this code to work with your app, you will need to put your credentials into a 
credentials.json file so that the code can read it.
